    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp olive oil </li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
            <li>250g chargrilled Mediterranean veg</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp small capers</li>
            <li>2 tbsp raisins</li>
            <li>350g rigatoni, penne or another short pasta shape</li>
            <li>bunch basil leaves, picked</li>
            <li>parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), shaved, to serve</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time â€“ the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.</li></p>
            <p><li>Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.</li></p>
            <p><li>Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan.</li></p>
