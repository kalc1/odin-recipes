            <p><li>After the cheese has melted and the pasta is creamy and cheesy, add in the smoked gouda and mozzarella then mix together until evenly distributed.</li></p>
            <p><li>Once the pasta has cooled enough to stick a finger without being burnt, put in 3 large eggs -  whisking together vigorously until the eggs are nice and smooth.</li></p>
            <p><li>Place into a casserole dish, smooth it all out then cover/sprinkle on top with 4 ounces of shredded yellow and white cheddar cheese along with the 2 oz of grated parmesan.</li></p>
            <p><li>After the cheese is evenly coated on top, place the casserole dish into a 375Â°F oven for about 45 minutes until golden brown.</li></p>
            <p><li>Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li></p>
